## System Architecture

The project is built with Python 3.11, adhering to Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

**Core Architectural Decisions:**

- **Modular Design:** 253+ service modules organized in `services/` layer
- **Factory Pattern:** `AWSClientFactory` and `ServiceFactory` for dependency injection
- **State Management:** `DynamoDBStateManager` for persistent state and checkpointing
- **Resilience:** `RetryHandler` with exponential backoff and `ResilientExecutor`
- **Extensible Service Layer:** `BaseAWSService` abstract base class with standardized interfaces
- **Testing Strategy:** 1842+ unit tests with Pytest and moto mocking

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Financial Analysis:** Multi-period cost analysis, trend detection, service-level breakdown
- **Operational Monitoring:** EC2/Lambda insights, custom metrics, real-time processing
- **Optimization Recommendations:** AWS Compute Optimizer integration, right-sizing, ROI analysis
- **Multi-Account Support:** Organizations, Control Tower, cross-account analysis
- **Security & Compliance:** Security Hub, Macie, GuardDuty, Detective integration

## External Dependencies

- **AWS SDK for Python (boto3):** Core AWS interaction library
- **pytest:** Testing framework with 1842+ tests
- **moto:** AWS service mocking for tests
- **pytest-asyncio, pytest-mock:** Testing plugins
